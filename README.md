# Breadth-first Search (BFS) without queue/stack

Suppose you are given the root of a fully populated tree (i.e. a Node instance called rootNode). Write code to set the 'Right' property so that each node is linked to right siblings without using a queue or stack.

Big O time complexity: O(n), n is the number of nodes.
